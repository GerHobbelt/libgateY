- fix issues on disconnect
- replace libwebsockets with server from gamedevwebtools? 
  Has better license, C++ smaller, but probably less well tested
- rename openSendGate to publish openReceiveGate to subscribe(string name)
- c++ adl problem: function serialise is only looked for in the namespace where the first
  argument lives (for example std for serialize(std::vector, JsonValue).
  Change JsonValue to gatey::JsonHolder (rename to gatey::Json) is better anyway
- Handle SIGPIPE (on OS X at least)
