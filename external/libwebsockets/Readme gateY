Forked from libwebsockets (licensed under LGPL with static link exception)
Source and header files taken from a minimal build (without client, wihtout daemonize, no extensions)

Changed includes to:

#ifndef WEBSOCKET_IS_AMALGAMATION
#include "..."
#endif

To allow single header / single cpp file script
